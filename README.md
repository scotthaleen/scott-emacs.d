###My emacs thingy


checkout yasnippets [snippets](https://github.com/AndreaCrotti/yasnippet-snippets/tree/master) 
to `~/.emacs.d/yasnippet-snippets`


Started from Alan's [emacs.d](https://github.com/alandipert/alan-emacs.d)



### Setup

Install emacs through [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)

```sh
$ brew options emacs
$ brew install gnutls librsvg imagemagick@6
$ brew install emacs --with-cocoa --with-imagemagick@6 --with-gnutls --with-librsvg
```

Make sure homebrew is setup correctly with `/usr/local/bin` first in your [search path](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10343834/homebrew-wants-me-to-amend-my-path-no-clue-how).


To make sure that the correct version is being launched run 

```sh
$ emacs --version

### Install

Clone this repo. If you already have a `~/.emacs.d/` directory (and do not need anything in it) delete it.  Then move/rename the clone repo to `~/.emacs.d/` then just launch `emacs` and wait for it to install the packages.

For example:

```sh
$ rm -rf ~/.emacs.d/

$ git clone https://github.com/scotthaleen/scott-emacs.d ~/.emacs.d 

$ emacs 
```
